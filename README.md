`phantomcall/` - Utilizing the author's code, experimentally tested and verified the results of the paper. Many of the gadgets they utilized were difficult to recreate, and their code was necessary to properly recreate the work
`inception/scripts` - scripts utilized to gather metrics, find kernel gadgets, and determine location of mmaps/root hash/kernel modules
`inception/kmod` - updated the kernel module to accept custom input for demo purposes
